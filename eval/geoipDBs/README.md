# GeoIP Lookup

The evaluation code uses the Maxmind GeoLite2 databases to look up IPs to country and autonomous systems.
Due to licensing reasons we cannot provide the Geolite2 databases directly, unfortunately.

You can download them at [Maxmind](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), after creating an account.
We need the country and autonomous systems databases, filenames are
	
	GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb
	GeoLite2-Country.mmdb

If you are having trouble obtaining these, send us message so we can work something out.
